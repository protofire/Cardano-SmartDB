## Introduction

The Smart DB Library is a Node.js package designed to simplify the interaction between JavaScript entities, a database, and the Cardano blockchain. It enables developers to work with entities backed by a database and synced with the blockchain, providing a transparent and seamless experience.

## Features
- **Hooks and Stores**: Provides useHooks and EasyPeasy stores to deal with wallet connection.
- **Seamless Blockchain Integration**: Simplify interactions with the Cardano blockchain using JavaScript entities.
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Automatically synchronizes the application after transactions are confirmed to reflect the latest blockchain state in the internal database. Users can also trigger synchronization manually if needed.
- **Authorization**: All API endpoints are secured with authorization logic using Next.js sessions and JWT tokens.
- **API Handling**: The library handles all API routes, reducing the complexity in the projects that use our library.
- **Example Project**: Includes a comprehensive example project in the `example` folder demonstrating the use of the library.
- **Node.js Dependency**: This is a Node.js library to add as a dependency in dApps projects.
- **Database Flexibility**: Now supports both non-relational databases (using MongoDB via Mongoose) and relational databases (using PostgreSQL via TypeORM), giving developers the flexibility to choose the most appropriate database solution for their project.

### Automatic Synchronization

All transactions are tracked in the internal database. Transactions have a 'state' attribute. When a transaction is in the 'Submitted' state, a background job on the backend periodically checks the blockchain (using the Blockfrost API) for confirmation. Once confirmed, the job updates the transaction state to 'Confirmed' and triggers the necessary synchronization actions.

#### Transaction Flow
1. User initiates a transaction on the frontend.
2. The frontend calls a backend API, sending transaction details.
3. The backend creates a 'Pending' transaction entry in the database and returns a serialized transaction code.
4. The user signs and sends the transaction to the blockchain.
5. The transaction state in the database is updated to 'Submitted'.
6. A backend job periodically checks the blockchain for confirmation.
7. Upon confirmation, the job updates the state to 'Confirmed' and initiates synchronization.

#### Highlights
- Users do not have to wait after submitting a transaction â€“ they can close the browser, and the backend will handle confirmation.
- The frontend periodically checks with the backend for updates on the transaction status.
- This solution is secure as long as our backend is running, and it avoids relying on third-party webhook services.
- If the backend job goes down temporarily, it can be restarted to catch up on any 'Submitted' transactions.

## Conclusion

The Smart DB library aims to bridge the gap between traditional web application development and blockchain-based data management. By abstracting complex blockchain operations into more familiar JavaScript entity interactions, it offers a developer-friendly pathway to blockchain integration. This example project is just the beginning, showcasing the potential for simplified blockchain interactions within web applications.

Remember, this is an evolving project, and future updates may introduce features enhancing the user experience and streamlining the development process.
